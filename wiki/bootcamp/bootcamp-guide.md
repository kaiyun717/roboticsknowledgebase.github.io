title: Software Bootcamp
---

The [MRSD Software Bootcamp](https://github.com/RoboticsKnowledgebase/mrsd-software-bootcamp) is designed as a self-paced, self-guided course to help starting robotics engineers and students get up-to-speed with the basic software skills needed for robotics. 
Originally developed to help incoming Master of Science - Robotic Systems Development (MRSD) students at Carnegie Mellon University, this course is open to everyone for learning the essential robotics software skills.
Some sections are accompanied by a set of exercises that you can complete to test your knowledge. 
Each topic aims to explain the foundational concepts and practical usage of a particular tool or platform and provide you with the resources you need to learn more. 
While you can find below a recommended order of topics, you are free to explore the topics in any order you wish, following external and internal hyperlinks as you see fit.
Some of the exercises are directly linked to the source and they are not a part of the MRSD bootcamp developers.

## Basics
Here, we go over some of the basic tools commonly used in robotics. We don't go over the basics of programming since there are already ample tutorials and resources available online (we compiled a list of tutorials for this in the [Resources](#resources) tab below).

1. [Linux basics](https://github.com/RoboticsKnowledgebase/mrsd-software-bootcamp/blob/main/linux/linux-101.md)
2. [Version control basics](https://github.com/RoboticsKnowledgebase/mrsd-software-bootcamp/blob/main/version-control/version-control-basics.md)
3. [ROS basics](https://github.com/RoboticsKnowledgebase/mrsd-software-bootcamp/blob/main/ros/ros-101.md)
4. Gazebo basics
